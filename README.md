# CharityBotJava
This was originally made for winning contests, but I thought I could do some good and have it win contests for charity hence the name "CharityBot." You can use this for just winning contests for yourself too though. It's all up to you. 
This bot will poll for Retweet Contests and retweet them. Inspired by http://www.hscott.net/twitter-contest-winning-as-a-service/
